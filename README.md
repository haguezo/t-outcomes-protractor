# Test Automation with Jasmine, Karma and Protractor

Automated test suite (testing at the front-end and component level) using the behaviour driven JavaScript testing framework [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) along with [Protractor](https://www.protractortest.org/#/) to automate the browser and [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/) as the test runner.  

The application under test is an [Angular](https://angular.io/) web app.

## Test Automation with Cypress

I also created an aternative automated test suite using the JavaScript end to end (E2E) testing framework [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).  These tests can be found [here](https://github.com/haguezo/t-outcomes-cypress).
